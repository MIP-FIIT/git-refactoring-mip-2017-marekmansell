# Refactoring comments
While refactoring this code, I have made the source code much more readable and maintainable. Most of the work has been done on creating proper comments, which habe not been properly written in the earlier verion. Secondly, I have renamed variables to apropriate names. Another important change was made in the *if* statements, where double brackets with an exclemaing mark were replaced with a comparison to *0*. Each function was tailored so that it contains only the code appropiate for the given task.
